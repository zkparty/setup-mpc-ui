  Each circuit can only have one contributor at any given time.
  If a contribution is in progress when you join, you will be placed in a queue. 
  <br /><br />
  You will be notified when you are actively contributing or waiting. 
  Once you have contributed to all circuits you will see a link(*)
  to a gist showing your contributions and their hashes.

  * For users who opt out of automatic gists, the attestation details will
  be copied to the clipboard, the GitHub gist page will open in a new tab, and 
  the gist can be created by pasting from the clipboard.

    After your participation you will be presented with a contribution
    hash. Please copy and paste it to a document you save on your computer.
    You will be able to use it to verify that your contribution was
    used by the next participant once we upload the complete contribution 
    transcript to the <StyledLink href='https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/www.trusted-setup-pse.org/clrfund/index.html' target='_blank'>website</StyledLink>.

    <NormalBodyText>
    Our trusted setup is done in 2 steps. The first step 
    is already done and is called Perpetual Powers of Tau. 
    Itâ€™s an ongoing effort led by Wei Jie of the Ethereum 
    Foundation and the basis for many other ceremonies 
    such as tornado.cash and Hermez. The second step is 
    called Phase 2 and is circuit-specific, so it is 
    done separately for each different SNARK circuit. Our 
    phase 2 is based on the 54th 
    contribution to Perpetual Powers of Tau ceremony.

    <H3Title>Why a trusted setup?</H3Title>
    <NormalBodyText>
      ZK-SNARK applications rely on a number of different circuits
      and each requires a trusted setup which ensures that
      no one is able to fake proofs and steal user funds or
      compromise privacy. The setup is performed in such a way
      that, to fake a proof, an attacker must compromise every
      single participant of the ceremony. Therefore, the security
      goes up with the number of participants.

            You will be asked to grant authority to the app to write a gist. Your contribution hashes will
            be saved in the gist as a public attestation, and you'll be given the opportunity to link to it in a tweet.
            <br /><br />
            Should you prefer not to grant this permission, we would ask that you create the gist under your 
            own GitHub login. This option can be selected from the menu, then <b>Options</b>, then check <b>Manual Attestation</b>.
            Do this before logging in to the application.
            Provided you're signed in to your GitHub account on the browser, a tab will be opened ready for you to create the gist 
            after you contribute. Just paste to the body, give it a file name (say, <code>attestation.txt</code>), change to <b>Public</b>, 
            and click <b>Save</b>.
